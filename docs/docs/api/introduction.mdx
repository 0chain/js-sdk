# Introduction

Before using the Züs JS SDK, you need to initialize the SDK first. See [Quick Start guide](/docs/getting-started/quick-start) for more details.

After initializing the SDK, you can use the Züs JS SDK to perform various operations such as creating and managing allocations, uploading and downloading files, executing smart contracts, and more.

## SDK Methods Index

In this guide, we will introduce you to all the available methods provided by the Züs JS SDK.

### Wallet Methods

The wallet methods allow you to create and manage wallets, set the wallet, and get wallet information.

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `createWallet` | Create a new wallet. Also, helps to recover a wallet using its mnemonic phrase. |
| `createWalletKeys` | Create a new wallet keys and mnemonic. |
| `getPublicEncryptionKey` | Get the public encryption key by wallet mnemonic. | 
| `isWalletId` | Check whether thef wallet id is valid. |
| `send` | Send token from one wallet to another. |
| `getWalletBalance` | Get the balance of a wallet. |
| `getUSDRate` | Get the USD rate by token symbol. (e.g. `zcn`, `eth`) |

### Burn & Mint Methods

The `initBridge` method must be called to initialize the bridge client before using the any of the burn and mint methods.

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `initBridge` | Initalize the bridge for calling burn and mint functions. |
| `burnZCN` | Bridge method to burn ZCN tokens. |
| `mintZCN` | Bridge method to mint ZCN tokens. |
| `getMintWZCNPayload` | Bridge method to get *Mint WZCN Payload* for a given burn transaction hash. |
| `getUnprocessedWZCNBurnEvents` | Get all unprocessed WZCN burn events from the Ethereum network. |
| `getProcessedZCNBurnTickets` | Get all processed ZCN burn tickets burned for a certain ethereum address. |
| `estimateMintWZCNGasAmount` | Perform gas amount estimation for the given Mint WZCN transaction. |
| `estimateBurnWZCNGasAmount` | Perform gas amount estimation for the given burn wzcn transaction. |
| `estimateGasPrice` | Perform gas estimation for the given transaction using Alchemy enhanced API returning approximate final gas fee. |
{/* | `getFaucetToken` | Get test tokens for testing. | // DOTODO: add how to get test tokens in devnet */}

### Allocation Storage Methods

The allocation storage methods allow you to create, update, and manage allocations.

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `createAllocation` | Creates an allocation with the specified allocation terms and preferred blobber IDs. |
| `getAllocationMinLock` | Retrieves the minimum lock value for the allocation creation. |
| `listAllocations` | List all the allocations. |
| `getAllocation` | Gets allocation details for a given `allocationId` from cache or the blockchain. |
| `reloadAllocation` | Re-fetches allocation details using `allocationId` from blockchain and updates cache.  |
| `getAllocationWith` | Get allocation details of a free allocation or a shared allocation details by using an authTicket. |
| `freezeAllocation` | Freeze an allocation so that the allocation data can no longer be modified. |
| `cancelAllocation` | Cancel an Allocation |
| `updateAllocation` | Update the allocation settings |
| `updateAllocationWithRepair` | Updates your allocation settings and repairs the allocation if any blobber was replaced or added |
| `getUpdateAllocationMinLock` | Retrieves the minimum lock value for the allocation after update. |
| `updateForbidAllocation` | UpdateForbidAllocation updates the permissions of an allocation, given the permission parameters in a forbid-first manner. |
| `getUpdateAllocTicket` | This method is used to sign an "Update Allocation ticket". This ticket is needed to allow someone else to run update transaction for your allocation on your terms. |
| `transferAllocation` | Transfer the ownership of an allocation to a new owner |
| `checkAllocStatus` | Check the health status of the allocation.|
| `skipStatusCheck` | Skips the `checkAlloctionStatus` health status check of the allocation. |
| `repairAllocation` | Start a repair process for an allocation. |
| `repairSize` | Retrieves the repair size for a specific path in an allocation. |
| `createWorkers` | Manually create local workers that sync with the allocation. |
| `terminateWorkers` | Remove local workers that sync with the allocation. This is useful when switching between allocations. |
{/* createFreeAllocation // DOTODO */}

### Blobber Methods

The blobber methods allow you to retrieve information, manage and interact with blobbers.

| `getBlobberIds` | Get Blobber IDs from a list of blobber URLs |
| `getAllocationBlobbers` | Retrieves a list of blobber IDs of blobber which match your allocation terms |
| `updateBlobberSettings` | Updates the blobber settings |
| `getContainers` | GetContainers returns all the running containers in a given domain. |
| `searchContainer` | searchContainer searches for a container with a given name in a given domain. |
| `updateContainer` | UpdateContainer updates the given container ID with a new image ID in a given domain. |

### File Operation Methods

The file operation methods allow you to perform various operations on files.
