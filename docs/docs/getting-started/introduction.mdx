# Introduction

The Z端s JS SDK is a JavaScript client library that provides a convenient interface for interacting with the Z端s Network. It allows developers to perform various operations such as creating and managing allocations, uploading and downloading files, executing smart contracts, and more.

The JS SDK is written in TypeScript, so its TS type definitions are built in.

# Features

#### Easy to Use

The Z端s JS SDK offers a declarative, well-documented, easy to use, and a fully TypeScript-based API, enabling JavaScript developers to communicate with the [GoSDK](https://github.com/0chain/gosdk) WASM and interact the Z端s Network.

#### Powerful

Leverage multi-threaded operations for faster file transfers, enabling high-speed downloads and parallel uploads within a single batch for maximum efficiency.

#### Batteries Included

Provides WASM cache management for both standard WASM and enterprise WASM. Fetch and initialize WASM asynchronously and seamlessly switch between both WASM types.
